Title: NMR dataset from Gralka et al., 2015. DOI: 10.3945/ajcn.115.110536.
Description: NMR spectra for all samples were acquired with the use of a 
    Bruker spectrometer (Bruker Biospin srl) operating at 14.1 T 
    (600.13-MHz proton Larmor frequency) equipped with a triple resonance
    inverse cryo probe cryoprobe, an automatic tuning-matching unit, and 
    an automatic sample changer.

    MTBLS242 data have been parsed into a SummarizedExperiment object available
    in ExperimentHub.
